🏆 Judging Criteria Alignment

1. Creativity & Innovation (How is it unique?)

Instead of a boring timer, your app turns productivity into a boss battle game.

Each Pomodoro is a fight round: completing it damages the boss, failing it makes the boss counter-attack.

Dynamic boss images, attack/defense animations, and level progression make it stand out from normal Pomodoro apps.

2. Impact & Relevance (Who does it help and how?)

Helps students, professionals, and coders who struggle to stay focused.

Makes time management less stressful and more engaging, especially for Gen Z who are used to gaming rewards.

Can reduce procrastination and improve consistency in study/work routines.

3. Functionality & Execution (What works, what’s implemented?)

Fully functional Pomodoro timer with customizable durations.

Boss HP vs Player HP system with streak tracking.

Visual feedback: boss images change when attacking or defending.

Easily extendable: new bosses, difficulty levels.

4. User Engagement (How fun/motivating is it?)

Turns productivity into a challenge → users feel like “winning” when they focus.

Builds streaks and levels, giving dopamine hits like a game.

Simple UI but high replay/motivation value since every study/work session becomes a fight to win.
